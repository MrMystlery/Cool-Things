<p>hello this is a repository just to host some swf files and for hosting Ruffle so I can embed them on some google sites.</p>
<p>If your are interested in using this please check out this pastebin and replace the "SWF FILE HERE" part with any link from this <a href="https://xxsibxx.github.io/ruffleembedsetup112/swf/">swf file list</a> or with any links to SWF files you make</p>
<p>A video tutorial will be coming out and I will make a link to it here</p>
